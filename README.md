# wsapi-openresty

__wsapi-openresty__ is a [WSAPI](http://keplerproject.github.io/wsapi/) connector for [OpenResty](https://openresty.org/). WSAPI, among other things, defines an abstraction layer between your web application and the webserver it is running on, so your application would be webserver agnostic, being able to run on Apache, Xavante and now, OpenResty.

# Installing

Install it with [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org):

    luarocks install wsapi-openresty

# How to use

Take a look at the `samples` folder. There is an example configuration for _OpenResty_ that runs a simple _WSAPI_ application. To launch the example, first [install OpenResty](https://openresty.org/#Download).
Then open a shell and do the following:

~~~bash
cd samples
/path/to/openresty/nginx
~~~

Then navigate with your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

For an example of an actual application, you can take a look at [SeeRedis](https://github.com/ignacio/seeredis).

The documentation about WSAPI is [here](http://keplerproject.github.io/wsapi/manual.html) and if you're looking for other applications, take a look at [Orbit](https://github.com/keplerproject/orbit), [Mercury](https://github.com/nrk/mercury) or [Sputnik](http://sputnik.freewisdom.org/).
